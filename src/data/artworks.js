    description: "A vibrant exploration of color relationships and geometric abstraction. This piece emerged from months of study into how warm and cool tones interact across large surfaces, creating visual depth through careful layering and contrast.\n\nThe composition draws inspiration from mid-century color field painters while introducing contemporary sensibilities through its dynamic brushwork and textural variations.",
    artistNote: "This piece represents a turning point in my exploration of pure color. I wanted to capture that fleeting moment when colors seem to vibrate against each other, creating almost musical harmonies on the canvas."

    description: "Urban Reflections No. 7 captures a fleeting moment of harmony between architectural geometry and atmospheric light. The soft golden glow of late afternoon sunlight transforms rigid glass facades into fluid, almost organic surfaces that seem to breathe with shifting luminosity.\n\nThrough carefully layered glazing techniques and a restrained palette of muted blues, golds, and warm ochres, this piece invites contemplation on the liminal space between constructed and natural environments. The work embodies my ongoing investigation into how urban environments can reveal unexpected moments of beauty and transcendence.\n\nCreated over six weeks in my Brooklyn studio, each layer of paint was allowed to fully cure before the next application, building depth and complexity. The meticulous process allowed for precise control while allowing for moments of controlled spontaneity, creating surfaces that shift subtly with changing light.",
    seriesDescription: "The Urban Reflections series began in 2022 as an exploration of how contemporary architecture interacts with natural light and atmospheric conditions. Each work in this series focuses on a specific moment of visual transformation, capturing the ephemeral beauty that emerges when rigid geometric structures are softened by shifting light.\n\nWhat unites these pieces is not their subject matter, but their ontological investigation into the nature of perception and temporality. They ask viewers to reconsider their relationship with urban spaces—to see not just buildings and streets, but living canvases that constantly evolve with light, weather, and time of day.",
    artistNote: "There's a particular moment in my neighborhood when evening light strikes a row of glass facades, and for just ten minutes, the entire street seems to transform into something otherworldly. This painting is my attempt to capture that transformation, that moment when the mundane becomes transcendent.",
